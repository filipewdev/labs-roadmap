# Capstone I — Therapy Scheduling Platform

> **Type**: Capstone (multi-month build, not a weekend lab)
> **Purpose**: Losângela's real production app — a landing page + scheduling system for her therapy practice
> **Stack**: TypeScript throughout (Next.js frontend, Fastify backend), with tooling from the labs integrated
> **Build after**: Labs 03, 08, 09, 11, 14, 15, 19

## Overview

This is not a toy project — it will be used by real clients and a real therapist.
That constraint forces you to think about security, privacy, reliability, and user
experience in ways that tutorial projects never do.

**Core features:**
1. Public landing page for Losângela's practice
2. Client self-scheduling (book, reschedule, cancel)
3. Automated reminders (WhatsApp + email + SMS) 24h before each session
4. Per-session notes and therapeutic report editor (private, therapist-only)
5. Admin dashboard for Losângela (schedule overview, client list, reports)
6. Full observability (Prometheus + Grafana from Lab 06)
7. Deployed on a VPS behind Nginx (from Lab 05) with SSL

**What makes this portfolio-worthy:**
- It's live, in production, solving a real problem
- It integrates async messaging (reminders via RabbitMQ), observability, Nginx, n8n, and AI (optional session note assistant)
- It handles LGPD compliance — a real constraint that demonstrates professional maturity
- BrasilAPI used for national holiday detection (auto-block scheduling on holidays) and CEP lookup

## Reminder System

This is where everything from the labs comes together.

```
1. Client books appointment (API)
2. API creates appointment in PostgreSQL
3. A scheduled job (every 5 minutes) queries:
   SELECT * FROM reminders
   WHERE scheduled_for <= NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours'
     AND scheduled_for > NOW() + INTERVAL '23 hours'
     AND status = 'pending'
4. For each due reminder, publish to RabbitMQ
5. Reminder Worker consumes queue, sends via WhatsApp/email/SMS
6. Worker updates reminder.status = 'sent' | 'failed'
7. Failed messages → DLQ (same pattern as Lab 11)
```

**Scheduler implementation**: Use **BullMQ** (Redis-backed job queue) with a repeatable job running every 5 minutes. BullMQ gives you: reliable scheduling that survives server restarts, job deduplication (won't run twice if the previous run is still going), built-in retry logic, and a dashboard (Bull Board) for monitoring. This is the application-level equivalent of AWS EventBridge rules — an event (the timer) triggers an action (the reminder query).

**Why BullMQ over cron**: A cron job (`node-cron` or OS-level `crontab`) works for simple cases, but doesn't survive app restarts gracefully, doesn't prevent concurrent runs, and has no built-in retry. BullMQ handles all of this because the schedule state lives in Redis, not in the process. This distinction matters when your app runs in Docker and containers restart.

## LGPD Compliance Considerations

LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) is Brazil's GDPR equivalent.
For a therapy app handling sensitive health data, this is legally important.

1. **Consent**: Record explicit consent when clients book (timestamp + IP)
2. **Data minimization**: Only collect what's needed for scheduling
3. **Right to deletion**: `DELETE /api/clients/:id` must cascade and purge all PII
4. **Session reports**: Audit log every access to `session_reports` table
5. **No third-party analytics**: Use your own Grafana — no Google Analytics

---

## Open API Integration

**BrasilAPI** used for:
- `GET /api/holiday/v1/{year}` — auto-block scheduling on national holidays
- `GET /api/cep/v2/{cep}` — client address auto-fill from postal code

---

## Local Environment

All services run via `docker-compose.yml`. `docker compose up -d` must start:
PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Nginx.
The Next.js and Fastify apps run on the host during development.

A `Makefile` with `make up`, `make down`, `make logs`, `make test` standardizes the workflow (same pattern as Lab 14).

---

## Testing Strategy

This is a production app — testing is non-negotiable.

- **API**: Integration tests for all endpoints using `fastify.inject()` + `testcontainers` (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ)
- **Reminder worker**: Unit tests for scheduling logic; integration test verifying a message flows from queue to sent status
- **RBAC**: Tests that therapist-only routes reject client tokens and vice versa
- **LGPD**: Test that `DELETE /api/clients/:id` cascades and purges all PII

**CI**: `tsc --noEmit` → `eslint` → `vitest run --coverage` (≥80% coverage). CI must pass before every merge to `main`.

---

## Development Discipline

- **Conventional commits** throughout — this repo follows the same Git discipline as every lab
- **AI as reviewer, not generator** — first attempt always written by hand; AI reviews security-sensitive code (auth, LGPD, RabbitMQ error handling)
- **Branch workflow**: feature branches → PR → CI green → merge

---

## Disaster Recovery Plan

This is a production app with real client data. You need a DR plan before going live.

**Backup strategy**:
- PostgreSQL: automated `pg_dump` via cron every 6 hours → compressed → uploaded to Backblaze B2 or Cloudflare R2
- Redis: RDB snapshot + AOF persistence (built-in). Redis data is cache-only — loss is inconvenient, not catastrophic.
- RabbitMQ: messages are transient by design (DLQ catches failures). No backup needed.
- Session reports (sensitive): included in PostgreSQL backup. Consider encrypting the backup at rest.

**DR drill (required before M10 — go live)**:
- [ ] Drop the PostgreSQL database on a staging environment
- [ ] Restore from the latest backup
- [ ] Verify: client data intact, appointments correct, session reports readable
- [ ] Measure and document your RTO (recovery time) and RPO (data loss window)
- [ ] Write the results in the README: "RPO: 6 hours (cron interval). RTO: ~15 minutes (tested)."

**What to monitor for DR**:
- Backup script exit code (alert on failure via n8n or Grafana)
- Backup age (alert if last backup is older than 12 hours)
- Disk usage on VPS (alert at 80%)

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Write at least 3 ADRs for key architectural decisions. These demonstrate the
thinking behind the system — not just what you built, but *why* you built it
that way. ADRs are standard practice at mature engineering organizations and
signal senior-level thinking to reviewers.

**Required ADRs** (write as you make each decision, not retroactively):
- [ ] ADR-001: Why RabbitMQ for reminders instead of a cron job or Redis pub/sub
- [ ] ADR-002: Why Drizzle ORM instead of Prisma or raw SQL
- [ ] ADR-003: A decision of your choice (e.g., session storage strategy, notification channel priority, deployment topology)

Use the format from Lab 28 (System Design Practice): Status, Context, Decision,
Alternatives considered, Consequences.

Store ADRs in `docs/adr/` in the repo. They are part of the deliverable.

## Build Milestones

- [ ] M1: Database schema + API (appointments CRUD)
- [ ] M2: Booking UI (public-facing page)
- [ ] M3: Admin dashboard (schedule view)
- [ ] M4: Reminder worker (email first, then WhatsApp)
- [ ] M5: Session report editor (Tiptap rich text)
- [ ] M6: Landing page (polished, professional)
- [ ] M7: Observability wired in
- [ ] M8: Deploy to VPS + domain + SSL
- [ ] M9: LGPD compliance review
- [ ] M10: Go live — Losângela uses it with real clients
